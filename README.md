This was a fun present for a friend! I hand-drew and animated his favorite characters going for a swim. The "fishy" movement is a combination of transforms, varying alpha channels, and interpolation motion programming via RenPy's Animation and Transform Language (ATL).

*Features*
 - Transforms: To achieve a more realistic look of characters floating in the water, I used a combination of easing function Warpers. Here's a link to RenPy's ATL API, where it's explained in more detail: https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/atl.html
 - Images: Eight animated characters, animated background (lighting changes), semi-transparent animated seaweed (foreground and background), floating bubbles, small floating particles
 - Sound Effects: Aquarium BGM credit to Calming Tones on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J_C7SESXhs (file not included)

*Future To-Do*
- I want to make this into an actual screensaver! Probably in an object-oriented language. I ran into some limitations with Ren'Py.
- Might add in some customization options, e.g. changing the background to a swimming pool.

*Credits and Disclaimers*
Personal-use-only project. I hand-drew most of the images, but I do not own the copyrights to the characters, photography, or sound effects.
