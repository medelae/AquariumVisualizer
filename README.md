# AquariumVisualizer
Simulates 2D objects swimming in a virtual tank in Renpy (Python-powered). August 2020.

- *insert video here in future update*

This was a fun birthday present for a friend! I hand-drew and animated his personal favorite characters in the examples, but any compatible image would work. The "fishy" movement is a combination of transforms, varying alpha channels, and interpolation motion programming (Renpy's ATL).

Future Goals: I'd like to make this into an actual screensaver in a future project!

Note: I do not own the copyrights to the music or characters. This project was for personal-use only.
