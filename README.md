# AquariumVisualizer (Renpy)
Simulates 2D objects swimming in a virtual tank in Renpy. August 2020.

- *insert video here in future update*

This was a fun present for a friend! I hand-drew and animated his favorite characters in this version. The "fishy" movement is a combination of transforms, varying alpha channels, and interpolation motion programming via Renpy's ATL.

Future Goals / Projects: 
- I want to make this into an actual screensaver! Probably in an object-oriented language with GIF support .
