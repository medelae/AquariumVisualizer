# AquariumVisualizer (Renpy)
Simulates 2D objects swimming in a virtual tank in Renpy. August 2020.

- *insert video here in future update*

This was a fun present for a friend! I hand-drew and animated his favorite characters. The "fishy" movement is a combination of transforms, varying alpha channels, and interpolation motion programming via Renpy's ATL.

*Features*
 - Transforms: To achieve a more realistic look of characters "floating in the water", used a mix of Robert Penner's easing functions (https://easings.net/) to interpolate
 - Animated Background (Lighting changes)
 - Images: Eight animated characters, animated seaweed (foreground and background), floating bubbles, small particles
 - Sound Effects: Aquarium BGM credit to Calming Tones on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J_C7SESXhs

*Future To-Do*
- I want to make this into an actual screensaver! Probably in an object-oriented language.
- Might add in some customization options, e.g. changing the background to a swimming pool.
