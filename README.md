# AquariumVisualizer (Renpy)
Simulates 2D objects swimming in a virtual tank in Renpy. August 2020.

- *insert video here in future update*

This was a fun birthday present for a friend! I hand-drew and animated his favorite characters in the examples, but any compatible images would work. The "fishy" movement is a combination of transforms, varying alpha channels, and interpolation motion programming (Renpy's ATL).

Future Goals / Projects: 
- I'd like to make this into an actual screensaver. An object-oriented language would work better for this.

\* I do not own the copyrights to the music or characters. This was personal-use only.
